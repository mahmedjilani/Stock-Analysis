# Stock Analysis with VBA for Excel

The stock analysis and refactoring the code

---
Overview of the project	
The purpose behind the project is to help the end-user to process the stock data and determine whether they are worth investing in by calculating total volume traded for the year and yearly return for each stock.
The data set consist of stock tickers with their daily volumes, high & lows, open & closing prices, and adjusted closing price for both 2017 & 2018.
In the previously written code, there was room for code improvement to make the code run faster, efficiently (low memory utilization), and making the code easy to understand for anyone who want to refactor it even further and thatâ€™s what I have tried to achieve in this project.

Results


Processing time 

After refactoring the code, the processing time was reduced to 0.179 seconds and saved us 2.761 seconds for 2017 and 0.488 seconds for 2018. (see below)
